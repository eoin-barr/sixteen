This week I didn't have much time to work on a project due to college finals so I decided to build a quick lambda function using Golang. It's a simple function that takes a name and message and logs the response which can then be seen in CloudWatch. The main purpose of this project was to get comfortable working with lambda functions in Golang from both the terminal and AWS console.
