This week I built a really simple coin API using the [CrytoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation). I had finals this week and would have liked to have built out this API further to include user input to select the coins and currencies.

## How run the app locally

1. Clone this repository

2. Get an api key from the [CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation) and insert it into the code.
