# Sixteen Projects in Sixteen Weeks

Alongside the material covered in the final semester of my Masters, I also wanted to go deeper on a few select technologies. The first area I wanted to go deeper on was standard full stack features. These features included authentication, websockets, pagination and payments, with the technologies used being; Backend: Node, GraphQL, Prisma, Apollo and the Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ChakraUI. After this I went deeper on Golang primarily due to its reputation for being powerful at building cloud-native apps.
