A DNS is a database that links names (e.g. https://www.google.com) to a specific IP address (e.g. 212.58.246.92). DNS is a fundmanetal networking concept and this week I explored implementing a simple DNS Server and made a replica of [Prasath's](https://medium.com/@openmohan/dns-basics-and-building-simple-dns-server-in-go-6cb8e1cfe461) simple Golang implementation.
